# Website-Performance-Dashboard
In today's digital age, understanding website performance is crucial for optimizing user experience and increasing conversion rates. Analyzing key metrics such as page views, session duration, bounce rate, and conversion rate can provide valuable insights into user behavior and website efficiency. This project aims to create an interactive and insightful dashboard using Power BI to visualize website performance metrics.
Data Description
The dataset, website_performance_analytics.csv, contains the following variables:
Visitor_ID: Unique identifier for each visitor.
Page_Views: Number of pages viewed by the visitor during a session.
Session_Duration: Duration of the session in seconds.
Bounce_Rate: Percentage of visitors who leave the site after viewing only one page.
Conversion_Rate: Percentage of visitors who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign-up).
Traffic_Source: Source from which the visitor arrived at the website (e.g., Direct, Organic Search, Paid Search).
Exit_Pages: Pages from which visitors exit the site.
Load_Time: Time taken to load the webpage.
Visitor_Type: Type of visitor (e.g., New, Returning).
Location: Geographic location of the visitor.

I created a comprehensive dashboard that provides a clear overview of website performance metrics. This dashboard will help in identifying trends, understanding user behavior, and making data-driven decisions to optimize website performance.
